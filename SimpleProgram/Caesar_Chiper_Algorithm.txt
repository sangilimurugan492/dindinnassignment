Algorithm for Caesar Cipher:

Input:

A String of either upper case or lower case letters, called rawString.
An Integer 0 to n denoting the required shift.

Procedure:

Traverse the given text one character at a time.
For each character, transform the given character as per the rule, depending on whether weâ€™re encrypting or decrypting the text.
Rule of the every charcter Trversal (En(x) = (x+n) mod 26 here x - single character and n - shifting value)
Return the new string generated.
Program that receives a Text (string) and Shift value( integer) and returns the encrypted text.

Disadvantages of using ASCII values

More bits are needed for non-ASCII characters, so some documents take a bit more space than with encodings that are specific to a particular language or writing system. However, standard text compression mitigates this in most cases.
One cannot simply assume that every character is a fixed size, so text processing should be done using the ICU libraries rather than counting bytes.
You might have to think about characters other than Latin.
It supports emoji characters.
